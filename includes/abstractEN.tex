The bachelor thesis is focused on the design of a mobile application, which suggests two movie titles for two users, which could interest them both. The thesis includes studying the issue and the necessary technologies, analysis of the issue, its design, and finally, implementing a mobile application. The core of the theoretical part of the thesis is the analysis of methodologies used in recommendation systems and an overview of types of mobile applications. We also mentioned the framework and technologies we chose, which we used to create the application, and their advantages and justified why we chose them. The analytical part of the thesis contains a summary of existing solutions used to identify the necessary components and interactions. The software design of the final solution is described using the UML standard. The implementation part consists of recording the progress in developing the mobile application itself, while more complicated parts of the solution are described in detail. We also mentioned possible implementation improvements in the future. In the end, we evaluated our results, the solution and the benefits of the application.
